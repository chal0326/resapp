The press has previously reported that Musk was denied a high-level clearance to access the government's most sensitive secrets? I am concerned Musk's enormous business operations in China - a country whose intelligence agencies have stolen vast amounts of sensitive data about Americans, including U.S. government employee data by hacking U.S. government systems -- endangers U.S. cybersecurity and creates conflicts of interest that make his access to these systems a national security risk. As you are aware, the Treasury Department was recently breached by Chinese government hackers who compromised Treasury's systems and accessed thousands of sensitive documents, including Secretary Yellen's emails.' Musk's Tesla, which accounts for half of his net worth, operates its largest factory in China, producing more than 1 million cars per year in the country.' Tesla has also received several unusual concessions from the Chinese government, including Tesla to operate without a joint venture with a Chinese company, something no other car company is permitted to do. Tesla also received favorable loans by Chinese state-owned banks and pays a discounted corporate tax rate of 15% in China, something that could change quickly if Musk were to anger the Chinese government." In light of China's recent hack of the Treasury Department's systems, it seems unusual to be granting access to sensitive systems to an individual with such significant business interests in China.
